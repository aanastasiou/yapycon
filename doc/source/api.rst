=======================
``YaPyCon`` Plugin Code
=======================


``yapycon.py``
==============

This section includes the entirety of the main plugin code
with all of its explanatory inline comments.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/yapycon.py

``yasara_kernel.py``
====================

Unfortunately, including the complete ``yasara_kernel.py`` in this page
makes it impractically long.

You can still review the code, either through github or by
:download:`downloading it from this link. <../../src/yasara_kernel.py>`
