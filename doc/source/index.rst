Welcome to YaPyCon's documentation!
===================================

YaPyCon embeds a Python console in YASARA, *"...a molecular-graphics, -modeling and -simulation
program for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android"* thereby:

1. Enabling rapid prototyping of YASARA scripts
2. Offering common "shell" functionality such as:

   * Code auto-completion
   * Inline code documentation
   * Tighter integration with ``matplotlib``

4. Improving and expanding certain aspects of YASARA's Python functionality.
